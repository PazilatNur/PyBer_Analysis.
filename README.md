## Analysis Overview
In this analysis, we focused on analyzing ride share trends based on the city types. We categorized our data into 3 differennt city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. Our goal is to identify disparity among different city type and find opportunities to improve and expand our bussiness based on the analysis results.

## Anlysis Results:

Based on the city types, total number of rides differ significantly. And this is expected as we know that number of residents and potential addressible market size is different in each city type. 

- "Urban" has the biggest size of marker, hence we have the highest numbers of drivers from Urban category.
- Although Urban lowest average fare per ride, Urban has brought in highest amount of total fare (rev) due to the large number of drivers and requested rides.
- Rural lowest number of drivers and rides, but the average fare per driver is the highest.

### Total Fare by City type:

We have created a line chart to visulize the weekly trends of total fare by city types. And the line chart shows trends as the suammry we have provided above. 
- urban has the highest total fare per week, then suburban total fare amount stays in between urban and rural.
- Rural weekly totl fare mostly stays below $500, while Urban weekly total fare is 4X higher than rural total fare per week.
