# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
In this analysis, we focused on analyzing ride share trends based on the city types. We categorized our data into 3 differennt city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. Our goal is to identify disparity among different city type and find opportunities to improve and expand our bussiness based on the analysis results.

## Anlysis Results:

Based on the city types, total number of rides differ significantly. And this is expected as we know that number of residents and potential addressible market size is different in each city type. 

- "Urban" has the biggest size of marker, hence we have the highest numbers of drivers from Urban category.
- Although Urban lowest average fare per ride, Urban has brought in highest amount of total fare (rev) due to the large number of drivers and requested rides.
- Rural lowest number of drivers and rides, but the average fare per driver is the highest.

### Total Fare by City type:

We have created a line chart to visulize the weekly trends of total fare by city types. And the line chart shows trends as the suammry we have provided above. 
- urban has the highest total fare per week, then suburban total fare amount stays in between urban and rural.
- Rural weekly totl fare mostly stays below $500, while Urban weekly total fare is 4X higher than rural total fare per week. 


## Summary:

Based on the analysis, here are the recomendations:

1. Run a A/B test to identfy the reason for low ride demands in rural. Can we increase number of rides if we drop the fare amount per ride by certain percent? 
    - If test results confirm our hypothesis, we can increase total weekly fare by increasing demands and slightly lowering fare per ride
    - If not, fare can stay at the current value to maintain rural profitability.

2. Opposite to rural suggestions, we can further increase Urband total fare by slightly increasing the fare, given we have the lowest fare per ride. 


3. Between Mar and April total ride fare per week dropped significantly more for Suburban than other city types. During this time we can adjust fare per ride specifically to incentivize more people to take rides.
